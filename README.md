# BTC Security Factor

Plots Bitcoin hash rate, miner revenue, and "security factor".

The security factor is also extrapolated out to get an estimate of Bitcoin's relative security in the future.

## Security Budget
The security of PoW cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is proportional to miner revenue.
Miner revenue can then be referred to as the "security budget".

## Security Factor
Cost to attack must also scale with network value, so cryptonetworks must maintain a high security factor -- cost to attack as percentage of market cap.

## Declining Block Rewards
As block rewards decline, transaction fees become the sole source of Bitcoin security budget.

Some Bitcoin proponents argue that total tx fees paid will increase **relative** to network value as block rewards decline.

The data appears to support a very gradual relative increase, with a low point in about 10 years.
